CTMS - Commercial Transport Management System

Database Management System Project:
Commercial Transport Management System acts as an interface between the server and the client.
The clients are the customers who book transport either for their personal use or for transporting goods.
The servers are the people who run a transport company and they provide transportation services to their clients.
Whenever any request is made from the client side, it is captured and pushed into the database system at the transporter side so that they can easily fetch the requirement.
Similarly, whenever any request is accepted from the transporter, the details are updated back to the client database for the client to know that the request has been accepted.
For this purpose we use MySQL as the database at the backend and PHP and Javascript as the front end to develop the User Interface(UI).
